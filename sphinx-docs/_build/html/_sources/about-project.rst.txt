What is Image AI Detector?
-------------------------

Image AI Detector is a **Chrome extension** that helps you identify whether images you see online are **real photographs** or **AI-generated content**. Think of it as a "truth detector" for images - it analyzes pictures in real-time and tells you how likely they are to be created by artificial intelligence.

Why This Matters
---------------

In today's digital world, **AI-generated images** are becoming increasingly sophisticated and widespread. From social media to news websites, it's getting harder to distinguish between:

- ðŸ“¸ **Real photographs** taken by cameras
- ðŸ¤– **AI-generated images** created by tools like DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion

This matters because:

* **Misinformation**: AI images can be used to spread fake news
* **Trust**: We need to know what's real when making decisions
* **Transparency**: Understanding what's AI-generated helps us navigate the digital landscape
* **Education**: Learning to spot AI content is becoming an essential skill

How It Works
------------

The extension works like a smart assistant that:

1. **Scans the page** when you click the extension icon
2. **Analyzes each image** using advanced computer vision techniques
3. **Provides instant results** with confidence scores
4. **Shows detailed analysis** of what it found

The Future of Image Verification
-------------------------------

As AI technology evolves, tools like Image AI Detector will become increasingly important. We're working on:

* **More accurate detection** of the latest AI models
* **Video analysis** capabilities
* **Batch processing** for multiple images
* **Integration** with other verification tools

This project represents a step toward a more transparent and trustworthy digital world where users can make informed decisions about the content they consume and share.

.. note::
   **Remember**: While our tool is highly accurate, no AI detection system is perfect. 
   Always use critical thinking and verify important information through multiple sources.
