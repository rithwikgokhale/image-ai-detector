Business Problem
---------------

**Challenge**: The proliferation of AI-generated images has created a trust crisis in digital media. Users can no longer rely on visual content authenticity, leading to:

* **Misinformation spread** through fake images
* **Reduced trust** in digital content
* **Difficulty in fact-checking** visual information
* **Potential for manipulation** in news, social media, and business contexts

**Solution**: A browser-based tool that instantly analyzes images and provides confidence scores for AI vs. real classification.
